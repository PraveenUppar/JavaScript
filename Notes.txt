Javascript has the following -

- Interpreted
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it's executed line-by-line at runtime by the JavaScript engine in the browser or server environment. 

- Dynamically Typed
Variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific data type. Types are determined at runtime and can change as the program executes.

var a = 1;
a = "name";
a = true;

- Single threaded
JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment, meaning it processes one task at a time.

- Garbage collected
JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks by automatically reclaiming memory used by objects no longer in use.
 

 
The system consists of four main parts:

- Call Stack: 
This is where JavaScript actually runs code. It handles one instruction at a time. If the stack is busy, nothing else happens (the UI freezes).

- Web APIs: 
These are separate threads provided by the Browser (or Node.js). They handle the "waiting" tasks like setTimeout, DOM events, or fetch.

- Callback Queue: 
Once a Web API is finished (e.g., the timer hits 0), it drops the callback function here. It waits here until the Call Stack is empty.

- Event Loop: This is a continuous loop that checks two things:
Is the Call Stack empty?
Is there something in the Queue?
If yes to both, move the item from Queue to Stack.
