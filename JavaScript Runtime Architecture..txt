The system consists of four main parts:

- Call Stack: 
This is where JavaScript actually runs code. It handles one instruction at a time. If the stack is busy, nothing else happens (the UI freezes).

- Web APIs: 
These are separate threads provided by the Browser (or Node.js). They handle the "waiting" tasks like setTimeout, DOM events, or fetch.

- Callback Queue: 
Once a Web API is finished (e.g., the timer hits 0), it drops the callback function here. It waits here until the Call Stack is empty.

- Event Loop: This is a continuous loop that checks two things:
Is the Call Stack empty?
Is there something in the Queue?
If yes to both, move the item from Queue to Stack.
