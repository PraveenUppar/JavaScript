Javascript has the following -

- Interpreted
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it's executed line-by-line at runtime by the JavaScript engine in the browser or server environment. 

- Dynamically Typed
Variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific data type. Types are determined at runtime and can change as the program executes.

var a = 1;
a = "name";
a = true;

- Single threaded
JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment, meaning it processes one task at a time.

- Garbage collected
JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks by automatically reclaiming memory used by objects no longer in use.
